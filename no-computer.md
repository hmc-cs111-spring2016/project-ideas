## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.



### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

The basis for this language is West Coast Swing (ex: https://youtu.be/QiB-xYd9PSo?t=30), 
a type of social dancing with specific rules and technique. This can be explained as a 
DSL by translatingthose rules into a specific wording that results in particular steps 
done in a certain way. This helps anyone who wants to dance West Coast Swing to break down 
the movements. This is more aimed at beginner level dancers than advanced
dancers who have master most of the movement. By having this broken down as a
language, it can help beginning dancers organize the different movements they
have available to them and when it is appropriate to use them.

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

A DSL is appropriate because of the strict nature of West Coast Swing technique.
Unlike other social dances, the vocabulary of movement has more definition
and expectations as to how it's executed, especially at a competition level. 
Understanding and remembering all of the different pieces (and what is acceptable
when) can be a lot to manage at the beginner level. By understanding this information
as a language, it can be easier understood and manipulated.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I've been dancing west coast swing for a while, and I still feel a bit of thrill
when dancing it or watching it. I came up with this by trying to think of everday
activities that have specific rules to them, and this came to mind.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

West Coast Swing, partner dancing.

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 



### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_


### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
