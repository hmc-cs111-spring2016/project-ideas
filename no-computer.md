# No computer project


## The user and a language
The language is sidewalks. The user of this language would be city planners.


### What's the need?
City planners need a way to show pedestrians where to walk.


### Why a language?
Sidewalks address the need becuase they provide a fixed path for pedestrians
and that path can guarantee safety from dangers such as cars.


### Why you?
I am excited about this idea because it will dramatically decrease the number
of pedestrians wandering onto roads with cars.


### Domain
Pedestrian Safety from Motor Vehicles


### Interface (syntax)
A sidewalk consists of a connected network of paths that lead to destinations.


### Operation (semantics)
Once created, pedestrians will flow along the provided path of sidewalks to 
their given destination.

### Expressiveness
It should be easy to control the flow of pedestrians. It might also be able to
control the flow of motor vehicles because they are not allowed on sidewalks.
Sidewalks could in fact be turring comlete when combined with a set of 
destination. Given a destination, can it be reached on the sidewalk. So, although
nothing is impossible, anything other than controlling traffic would be difficult. 


### Related work
Roads are another DSL in this domain. They control the flow of car traffic.


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
Most of the time would be spent contruction of the system ... definitely 


### Scope
This is a very ambitious project that could reach to every city in the world.


### Benefits and drawbacks
A benefit would be that pedestrians would be safer. A drawback would be that
motor vehicles would no longer be able to drive wherever they wanted.
