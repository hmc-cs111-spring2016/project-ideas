# No computer project

_Note: Since these are project proposals but this file is specifically not_
_supposed to be computer related, I assume this is more about arguing that_
_something is a DSL and not about actually building it. (i.e. I don't know_
_if I can actually build a bike.) Sorry if thisanswer is a little too jokey!_

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

This language, a bike, would serve people who need to get around easier.
Here, we are assisting any able body person with a need to get somewhere
via self-propelled land vehicle. Although one may note land vehicles such as
cars, horses, and regular bikes already exist, one may note that these usually
primarily only provide exercise to a user's leg, if even. What if someone
wants to get somewhere, be fit, and skip leg day all at the same time? This
idea, a bike that pedals with your arms (a.k.a. the __ARM BIKE__), can allow
for all the convenience of a typical land vehicle, while enabling a strong
upper body workout.

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

When someone wants to go somewhere, they have a desire that they want to
express. Primarily, this language manifests itself verbally as simple commands
like "Go forward!", "Go backward!", "Stop!", and "Turn!" That being said,
the verbal DSL does not allow these desires to be fufilled. By using a great
interpreter like the __ARM BIKE__, these desires can be expressed as
physical commands that can then be executed in _real life_.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

It is a __BIKE__ that you use __WITH YOUR ARMS!__ What's not exciting about
that? I came up with this idea because I was thinking how disproportionally
strong my legs are relative to my upperbody. I generally find most upperbody
workouts are boring and would benefit greatly from something like this that
I could incoperate into my daily life by switching to the __ARM BIKE__ instead
of a regular bike.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Slow biking using feeble arms.

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 

The user would interact with the language by sitting on what may initally
appear to be a typical bike. That being said, upon closer examination one
will notice the interface for steering is controlled by your feet and the
interface for propulsion is powered by your arms. Additionally, rather
than having a typical rough traction petals, the physical petals
may be substituted for something like individual rotating mini handlebars.
Similarly, rather than handlebars for the feet, stationary footrests with 
small break petals attached to a turnable front will enable precision control. Finally, although I'm not certain how, the chair should probably be
redesigned for a more comfortable experience given the new configurations.
This is the right way to interact with this problem domain since it uses
the proven methodology of bikes with the advantage of an upperbody workout.

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

When the program runs, hopefully users will be able be able to move about.
As mentioned above, the hand petals and steering footrests would be how
the user interacts with the __ARM BIKE__. Hopefully the __ARM BIKE__ will
respond with a pleasant, sturdy, experience. Assuming the __ARM BIKE__
is well made and maintained, there shouldn't be much room for program
malfunctoins beyond human error. That being said, always wear a helmet.

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be easy to move about with this language, break, turn, and get a
good upperbody workout. Additionally, it should be difficult (or at least
as impossible as possible) to unintentionally hurt yourself.

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

Interestingly enough, (although I originally conceived this as a joke), this
appears to be a pretty popular exercise machine that can be purchased at
various retailers such as
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/MagneTrainer-ER-Mini-Exercise-Bike-Exerciser/dp/B000V53KD8)
or [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/bhp/arm-bike)

Additionally, a variety of real devices called Handcycles (or sometimes
handbikes) exists as an alternative to bikes for disabled users. They have a
wide range of designs to assist users with a wide range of different
disabilities. More information and images can be found
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcycle). Interestingly enough,
they don't appear to try to market these elsewhere.

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

Everything is a DSL! Therefore the whole part of building the bike is
designing how the person will be interacting with the device and seeing
their thoughts and desires be expressed in real life.

### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

I have no idea how to build a bike or weld metal, so this is a very big and
ambitious project. That being said, if I did this, it would certainly be one
of the coolest project I've ever done.

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_

This is a good idea because it is awesome! It is not a good idea because it is a
little beyond the scope.
