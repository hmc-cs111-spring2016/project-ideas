# Violin

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

Violin is a hard instrument. Rather than having a separated fingerbaord for each note, like frets on a guitar, violin simply has a continuous fingerboard. The violin produces different notes based off of where fingers are placed and in what combination. Having a language that emulates what happens when some combination of fingers are placed would allow users to focus more on the quality of the music rather than on producing the right sound. My computer-free project would be for novices learning violin for the first time, or people who don't have time to formally learn violin but have composition ideas. 

### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

This language would eliminate the need to practice (for years usually) to train both the ear to identify notes and the fingers to produce the correct notes. This language would help beginners understand proper finger placement as well as amateur composers that simply want to create a violin piece. 

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

This "DSL" is appropriate because all violin players use the same "DSL". Therefore, when players play the same piece, they are similar in sound. However, this "DSL" also has flexibility in that there are many ways to play the same piece. Though the notes may be exactly the same, the "DSL" allows the user to express their personal preference and tastes which is reflected in their sound.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

Growing up, learning violin was extremely frustrating. The concept of having to train the ear to recognize pitches in order to properly play the correct notes was baffling to me: I often complained about how the piano had discrete notes while the violin did not. This idea is exciting because a) I now regret having quit violin after maturing and recognizing how fun of a hobby instruments can be and b) so no one has to go through the struggle I did.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Violin is a hard instrument

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 

The user would give some placement of their fingers which would then produce some sound. Because the domain is extremely specific, this is pretty much the only way to interact with the problem domain, and therefore the right way.

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

When the user places their fingers on the fingerboard, they use a bow with their other hand to vibrate the strings and produce a note. The program interacts with the user based off of the note they hear. They correlate this note with their finger pattern. Had they misplaced their fingers (which is very likely), they will produce the wrong note and will correct appropriately.

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

*Nothing* is easy in this language. It should be possible to play correct notes based off of finger placement. Producing music from stringing together notes based off of various finger palcements is also possible. When the musical piece becomes more difficult e.g. requiring quick and accurate finger placement, playing the correct notes gets progressively harder. Given that there are only 4 strings and all cannot be played at the same time, it should be impossible to play 5+ note chords, which is possible on the piano.  


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

Other stringed musical instruments are very similar, such as the [bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_violin), [cello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello), and the very very close cousin [viola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola). They are all similar in that they have unmarked fingerboards; however, the cello and bass are played differently in the orientation of the instrument. 

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_
