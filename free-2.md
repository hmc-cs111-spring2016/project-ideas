# Free project 2


## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.


### What's the need?
The need is for programmers who want to easily create scripts to help them in their
everyday workflow. 


### Why a language?
I think a language would be good for this because you could easily specify repeatble
tasks to run. 


### Why you?
I think this idea is exciting because it could help coders have better access to
coding / creating scripts on the fly. I came up with it because not being able to
code short scripts conveniently enough is a problem that I face.

### Domain
Script Creation for Workflow Automation


### Interface (syntax)
I see the interface as basically defining keyboard macros for things that could
be useful in creating scripts. For example, quickly bring up a writing pad perhaps
in the background.

Open TextEditor
Compile in Python
Directory ~/Desktop/test


### Operation (semantics)
When a program runs, it would basically do all the work of setting up your coding
environment so all you have to do is start writing the code. Also ideally to compile
and run the code would just require a keyboard macro as well.


### Expressiveness
It should be easy to write programs to open and set up custom coding environments. It
might be possible to use the language to open arbitrary applications but it probably
would not be easy. It would be impossible to do anything besides opening programs and
setting systems variables. 


### Related work
I think currently shell scripts would be the way in which someone would go about
solving this problem. I think a language could improve on this by making it more
domain specific. Shell scripts are already pretty specific to working with the 
operating system but another language could be specific to setting up a coding
environment. 


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
I think time would be evenly distibuted implementing the system and designing
the language. 


### Scope
I do not think this project is very ambitious. I would only need a basic knowledge
of how to set up an environment in the given operating system. The language itself
could probably be written in Scala. 


### Benefits and drawbacks
I think one of the benefits would be that it would be very useful to me and some 
other coders. The drawback would be that it might not be useful to anyone else.
