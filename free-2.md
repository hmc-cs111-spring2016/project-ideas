# Free project 2


## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

This language would be for people with menstrual cycles to track and generate 
information about their periods. A language could be a useful way to address this, 
because the way people manage and track their periods is very personal. By using
a language, this might allow for more flexibility and personal customization.


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

Having information tracking a person's period and the related symptoms is
important health information. This data is useful to have during doctor's
visits and when planning everyday life. Theoretically, this could help
anyone with a period (cis-women, trans-men, and others). Right now,
there are a few apps on the market that help with tracking this sort
of thing, but a lot of them are frustrating to use or extremely feminized.
If I could provide this tool, it might be more comfortable to use in
more gender neutral settings and gives more options for people with
periods in general.


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

Periods are very personal. Using a DSL would allow for a lot more flexibility
in tracking in than sticking to the format and layout of an app. This also
could help with generate records which is useful when interacting with doctors.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I think this idea is exciting because having good care and knowledge of 
menstrual cycles is very important to personal health and productivity.
For cis-women in developing countries, this tends to be a factor that 
holds them back (such as in going to school or dealing with the stigma).
While I can't create a tool that address all of those problems, I like
the idea of coming up with a tool that can help with some of the issues.
I came up with this by googling some of the biggest problems currently 
facing cis-women.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
Tracking menstrual cycles and symptoms.


### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 


### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

To the best of my knowledge, the best that we have currently are iPhone/android
apps. The most popular of these is https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clue-period-tracker/id657189652?mt=8
which does a good job of staying gender neutral and providing a lot of scientific access.
To be honest, this app does a great job of providing information, reports, and calculations.For
example, they have lots of in app reference data about what typical symptoms look like. You 
can also produce data reports based on all the information you put in (about periods, sleep,
emotional state, etc). In comparison, a lot of other period apps are extremely feminized,
which is exclusive to people with periods who don't identify as female (see http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-best-period-tracker-apps-ios-android/). However, it is still 
limited to people who have access to smartphones/devices. For thosein lower income situations, 
it's easier to have access to a computer than a smartphone.

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

I think to make this an effective language, good research should go into the 
science behind having a period, the common terminology, and how to take the 
more specific medical language and translate it to something more accessible
in everday vernacular. Also, deciding what information is necessary and what
information is auxillary in tracking a period would take both research and
consideration. I think there could be some technical challenges if a lot of 
work went into taking this data and making predictions, but I think just
tracking it would be more technically simple.

### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

If it's literally just tracking the days you are/aren't on your period, 
then this could be an incredibly easy project (doable in less than an hour).
However, adding more detail to the type of data a user can manage and what 
they could do with that detail opens up a lot of possibilities and room
for this to grow.


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
