# Free project 3

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.


### What's the need?
People have trouble budgeting out time on their computers. 


### Why a language?
A language would provide enough expressiveness for users to specify their
schedule and what they should be doing on their computer.


### Why you?
This is an exciting idea because I think it is a problem most people face
on their computers: procrastination. I came up with this idea from talking
to multiple people about their problems with computers.


### Domain
Scheduling and Limiting Screen Time

### Interface (syntax)
I see the syntax as basically describing a schedule for a day and what allowed
apps/websites would be availiable at certain times. For example I want to 
accomplish a particular task and I need Safari and Eclipse to do it. Perhaps
I also want to make sure that I don't play any games instead.

Games = Chess, Pong

Task1 : 2 hours
	Safari
	Eclipse
	not Games



### Operation (semantics)
When a program runs, it blocks certain programs on your computer from running.

### Expressiveness
It should be easy to express what a schedule for computer time looks like.
Anything else would be rather difficult.


### Related work
There are a few apps that allow you to block websites and other 
apps on your computer.

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
I think the work would be split up pretty evenly between implementation 
and language design.


### Scope
I don't think this is a particularly ambitious project. It would just require
knowledge of how to block apps on a system which is clearly possible given
the above mentioned apps that already do this.


### Benefits and drawbacks
I think one of the benefits would be that it would provide a free and easy
solution / alternative to existing apps. One of the drawbacks of this project
is that it is not very novel. However, I could imagine novel features that could
be added to improve that.
